      <b><h2 style="text-align: center">Chapter 1</h2></b>
      <p>
        In a future world, people are born artificially and conditioned to fit
        into predetermined social classes. We meet the Director of the Hatchery
        and Conditioning Center, who explains the process to a group of
        students.
      </p>

      <b><h2 style="text-align: center">Chapter 2</h2></b>
      <p>
        We meet the main character, Bernard Marx, who is an outsider in this
        society because he is physically different. He meets Lenina Crowne, a
        woman he is attracted to, and invites her to go on a trip to a "Savage
        Reservation" with him.
      </p>

      <b><h2 style="text-align: center">Chapter 3</h2></b>
      <p>
        Bernard and Lenina arrive at the reservation and meet a young man named
        John, who was born naturally and has not been conditioned like the rest
        of society. They also meet the woman who raised him, Linda, who used to
        be part of their society but was abandoned on the reservation.
      </p>

      <b><h2 style="text-align: center">Chapter 4</h2></b>
      <p>
        John tells Bernard and Lenina about his life on the reservation, and
        they are shocked by the differences between their society and the one he
        grew up in. They witness a ritual where a young man is whipped, and
        Lenina is horrified.
      </p>

      <b><h2 style="text-align: center">Chapter 5</h2></b>
      <p>
        Bernard decides to bring John and Linda back to their society as a way
        to gain fame and recognition. The Director, who is secretly John's
        father, is furious with Bernard and threatens to fire him.
      </p>

      <b><h2 style="text-align: center">Chapter 6</h2></b>
      <p>
        John and Linda return to the society, and John struggles to adjust to
        the new way of life. He is fascinated by Lenina and wants to be with
        her, but she sees him as a strange outsider.
      </p>

      <b><h2 style="text-align: center">Chapter 7</h2></b>
      <p>
        John becomes increasingly frustrated with the society's shallow and
        superficial culture. He becomes popular for a brief time but then
        becomes disillusioned and angry.
      </p>

      <b><h2 style="text-align: center">Chapter 8</h2></b>
      <p>
        John becomes violent and is eventually arrested. He is taken to a
        hospital and is heavily sedated. When he wakes up, he is horrified by
        what has happened to him.
      </p>

      <b><h2 style="text-align: center">Chapter 9</h2></b>
      <p>
        The society's leaders decide to use John's story as a way to promote
        their values. They put on a show where John is publicly humiliated and
        then killed, which shocks the audience but reinforces their belief in
        their way of life.
      </p>

      <b><h2 style="text-align: center">Chapter 10</h2></b>
      <p>
        The novel ends with the realization that the society is unlikely to
        change, as most people are content with their lives and do not see any
        reason to question their values.
